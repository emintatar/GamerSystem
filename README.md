# Game Simulation System Project

## You want to write a game. We are planning to develop the backend codes for this software with C#. New members, sales and campaign management are required. You can give the properties of the objects as you want. The goal here is the quality of the code you write. The situation that you do not fully understand the requirements in the homework is not important, you can develop your own logic.

### Requirements:

#### 1. Simulate an environment where players can register to the system, update their information, and delete their registrations. We want to verify the accuracy of customer information using e-government systems.

#### 2. Simulate the sales environment where the game can be sold. (The sales made should be associated with the player. I mean the player in the method as a parameter.)    

#### 3. Simulate the possibilities of entering a new campaign into the system, deleting and updating the campaign.    

#### 4.  Simulate campaign integration in sales.
